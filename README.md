# gameStreetFighter2
final version game
-Technologies used: Canvas basically. Just some Vanilla Javascript for DOM Manipulation (for some text and buttons).
-Approach for the game: to apply the concepts of Javascript programming oriented to objects. this project has been very positive to reinforce 
and practice the concept of encapsulation in javascript. Split the problem and you'll win. Easier to manage.

Unsolved problems: refresh of the canvas environment. Still not solved. Easy solution is to refresh all the Canvas context,
but I'm trying to clear only the area used for the active sprite.

Movements for collisions: I have to program the collisions for the jump and throw object movements

On the main website, a button is missing so that players can access the control and movement keys.

Project is not over, will going on!!
